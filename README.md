## Overview
### Description
Meloday is a music-based social media app that asks users to choose a song to post once a day. New users are prompted to create a playlist and each daily song will be auto-added to the playlist. The post is shared online, where other users can like, comment, or share. Meloday is meant to encourage people to  create daily memories through music and view their progression throughout the year.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Music / Social Media / Entertainment
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily suited for mobile because of the flexibility and quicker access to user's phones. Since Meloday is meant to be used daily and the user receives daily notifications, user convenience is important.
- **Story:** Everyone listens to music - 270 million people in the US listen to music daily. Meloday personalizes this experience by culminating a year's worth of music into one playlist and creates a social environment with others. 
- **Market:** user - any individual who uses Spotify (the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service with 422 million users)
- **Habit:** Meloday is designed to be used at least once a day. A push notification is sent to users to remind them to post their song before the end of the day.
- **Scope:** Meloday would have the core feature of users being able to search for a song and select it as their song of the day. Using the Spotify API, I am able to leverage Spotify's library of over 82 million songs. The daily posts are stored in an external database that can be accessed from any device with Internet. In this case, I am using Parse, a platform that allows developers to build mobile apps with shared data.

## Product Spec

### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

**Required Must-have Stories**

[x] User accounts
   [x] Users are able to login via Spotify authentication/logout from Meloday without having to sign out of the Spotify as well
   [x] Meloday remembers if the user is currently logged in
   [x] New users can create a Meloday playlist
[x] Users are able to search for a song
[x] Users are able to post the searched song to the timeline

    * Maybe have the user be able to add a song any time of the day but have a notify reminder at end of day if user did not add a song?

**Planned Problems**
[x] Set daily notifications that remind user to post their song. Allow users to customize the set daily reminder to notify at a certain time of the day and save this data. 
[x] Play song snippets from within the app when you click on a song cover from the home timeline. Animate the audio with a smooth waveform.

**Optional Nice-to-have Stories**
